Turning Hello Dolly into a Freemium WordPress plugin.

## Folders Structure
- *original*: The original Hello Dolly plugin written by Matt Mullenweg.
- *extended*: Extended plugin version that adds three extra Louis Armstrong songs.
- *freemium v.1*: Freemium version of the extended plugin powered by Freemius. Each song is only available in the corresponding plan.
- *freemium v.2*: Another freemium version of the extended plugin. Instead of not showing the songs if the user doesn't have the required license, all the songs are shown in the settings but they're disabled to incetivize the user to upgrade.
- *freemium v.3*: Same as *freemium v.1* except the songs are available inside a Gutenberg block to demonstrate monetization of block features.
